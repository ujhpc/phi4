\section{Introduction}

The Graphical Processing Units (GPU) emerge these days as the most
efficient devices for numerical calculations. To ascertain this it is
sufficient to look at the list of 500 supercomputers\cite{top500} and count how
many of them have GPU accelerators and this trend is still
increasing. This was made possible not only by the accessibility of
the hardware but also by the realization from the side of the vendors
that those units can be used also for computations, and providing user
with suitable software interface to do this. Technologies like CUDA
and OpenCL make the GPU relatively easy accessible to C/C++
programmers. In the meantime also most of the numerical packages
vendors have added GPU support to their tools.

However like with most of the computer languages there is a learning
gap between using them and using them efficiently. The GPU are not
only {\em massively parallel} machines but essentially {\em vector
  machines}. This is a trend visible also in the CPU market: the SSE
extensions introduced four floats wide vector (SIMD) instructions, AVX
eight floats wide and Xeon $\phi$ 16 floats wide\footnote{The Xeon
  $\phi$ strictly speaking is not a CPU but an accelerator. However
  its cores are based on Intel CPU Pentium architecture.}. To get most
out of the hardware it is crucial to vectorize the algorithm and make
good use of the available memory hierarchy.


In this contribution we present an efficient, vectorized
implementation of the Monte-Carlo simulations of the $\varphi^4$ or
Ginzburg--Landau model both on GPU and CPU. Monte-Carlo simulations of
this type play an important role in statistical physics and field
theory. Those simulations are usually very time consuming so the speed
of the algorithm is of a paramount importance. Similar model have been
ported to GPU, however they were mainly discrete spin models with
nearest neighbor interactions\cite{spin1,spin2,weigel}.  We use a continuous field model
with extended neighborhood that to our knowledge was not yet ported to
the GPU.


\section{Ginzburg--Landau model and Monte-Carlo simulations}

Ginzburg--Landau model that we use in its discretized form is defined by the
Hamiltonian\cite{parisi}:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:hamiltonian}\begin{split}
H[\varphi]&=\sum_{\vi}\Biggl(
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^d(\vphi(x_\vi+\a{\mu})-\vphi(x_\vi))^2\\
&\phantom{=\sum_{\vi}\bigl(}+\frac{\mu^2}{2}|\vphi(x_{\vi})|^2+
\frac{g}{24}(|\vphi(x_{\vi})|^2)^2\\
&\phantom{=\sum_{\vi}\bigl(}+
\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\Bigl(\sum_{\mu=1}^d
(\vphi(x_\vi+\a{\mu})-2\vphi(x_{\vi})+\vphi(x_\vi-\a\mu))\Bigr)^2\Biggr).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $\vphi$ is a scalar\footnote{In general this can be a vector,
  but in this contribution we restrict ourselves to scalar case.} field
defined on the sites of a two or three dimensional lattice. The $x_i$
denote the sites of the lattice where $i$ is a multidimensional index
and $\a\mu$ denotes the unit vector in the direction $\mu$. We use
periodic boundary conditions.  The Monte-Carlo simulations consist of
generating the field configurations with probability proportional to
$\exp(-H(\vphi))$.

The  generation is done by the mean of the Metropolis
algorithm. This amounts to sequentially updating all the points of the
lattice. During each update we change the value of the field $\vphi$
in on a single lattice point ($\vphi_i$ is a shorthand for $\vphi(x_\vi)$).
\begin{equation}
\vphi_i\longrightarrow\widetilde{\vphi_i}=\vphi_i+\eta.
\end{equation}
The $\eta$ is a pseudo--random number drawn from a distribution such
that $P(\eta) = P(-\eta)$. In practice we draw  $\eta$ from the
uniform distribution on interval $[-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$.  Then we
calculate the difference of the Hamiltonian's
\begin{equation}
\Delta H=H[\widetilde{\vphi_i}]-H[\vphi_i].
\end{equation}
If $\Delta H < 0$ we accept the change and substitute
$\widetilde{\vphi_i}$ for $\vphi_i$, otherwise we accept the change
with the probability $\exp(-\Delta H)$. In other words we accept the
change with the probability
\begin{equation}
P(\vphi_i\rightarrow\vphi_i+\eta)=\min\left(1,\exp(-\Delta H)\right)
\end{equation}
The crucial feature of this algorithm is that the update is local {\em
  i.e.} $\Delta H$ depends only on the values of fields in the
immediate neighborhood of the updated point 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta H & = -(\widetilde{\vphi_i}-\vphi_i)
\underbrace{\left(c^{01}_i-\frac{1}{\Lambda}(c^{02}_i-4 d c^{01}_i+2 c^{11}_i )\right)}_{c_i}\\ 
&\phantom{= -}
+(\widetilde{\vphi}^2_i-\vphi_i^2)\left(d+\frac{\mu^2}{2}+d (1+2d)\frac{1}{\Lambda}\right)\\
&\phantom{= -}+\frac{g}{4!}\left(\widetilde{\vphi}^4_i-\vphi^4_i\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\begin{split} 
c_i^{01}&=\sum_{\mu=1}^d\left(\vphi(x_\vi+\a\mu)+\vphi(x_\vi-\a\mu)\right)\\
c_i^{02}&=\sum_{\mu=1}^d\left(\vphi(x_\vi+2\a\mu)+\vphi(x_\vi-2\a\mu)\right)\\
c_i^{11}&=\sum_{\mu=}^d\sum_{\nu=1}^{\mu-1}
\bigl(\vphi(x_\vi+\a\mu+\a\nu)+\vphi(x_\vi-\a\mu-\a\nu)\\
&\phantom{+=\sum_{\mu=}^d\sum_{\nu=1}^{\mu-1}
}
+ \vphi(x_\vi+\a\mu-\a\nu)+\vphi(x_\vi-\a\mu+\a\nu)
\bigr)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The term $c_i$ is referred to as {\em corona}. 
In our case, because of
the last term in \eqref{eq:hamiltonian}, this neighborhood is
extended as compared to usual nearest neighbors (see figure~\ref{fig:nn}). 


\section{GPU implementation}

While model is inherently parallelizable, grid points that lie in the
same neighborhood cannot be updated together. Taking into account a
larger neighborhood means that a simple checkerboard decomposition
pattern cannot be used and we have devised a new grid decomposition
scheme. We choose the decomposition depicted in the
figure~\ref{fig:part}. In 2D we need eight sublattices and 16
sublattices in 3D.

The GPU is no exception as to what concerns the speed of the memory
access.  While very fast, the throughput from global memory is still
almost two orders of magnitude slower then needed to sustain the
maximal instruction throughput.  The NVIDIA cards we use contain so
called { Scalar Multiprocessors} (SM). On Fermi architecture each SM
is equipped with up 48KB shared memory and 32K of 32bit
registers\cite{Fermi} which act as user managed cache. While starting
from the compute capability 2.0 Nvidia cards are also equipped with L1
and L2 caches, the use of automatic cache is, as we will show later,
no advantageous in terms of performance.

To efficiently use the shared memory  we adopt the hierarchical scheme from
ref.~\cite{weigel} suitably modified to account for bigger
neighborhood.  We first divide the whole lattice in blocks of
$B_x\times B_y$ points (see figure~\ref{fig:blocks}).

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:blocks}Partition of the lattice into
  blocks.  The sites 
marked in gray are loaded into shared memory.}
\end{figure}
To process each point inside a block we also need the neighboring
points.  We divide the grid of blocks into subgrids in such a way,
that blocks together with the neighborhood in each subgrid do not
overlap (see gray points in figure~\ref{fig:blocks}). In 2D we need
four of such subgrids and eight in 3D case.

We then start a kernel that process all blocks in one subgrid.  Each
block in this subgrid is assigned to a block of $N_{th}$ threads (CTA
-- Cooperative Threads Array). First we fetch the values of the fields
from global to shared memory (including border points see
figure~\ref{fig:blocks}).  In 3D we use $B_x=B_y=B_z=16$ which gives
altogether $20^3$ field values to be loaded. This gives $32$KB which
fits nicely into 48KB shared memory.


After that each thread updates one site
from the first sublattice. This is done $N_{hit}$ times resulting in
what is know as {\em multi-hit} metropolis algorithm. The advantage is
that the corona $c_i$ does not need to be recalculated again and most
of the needed variables resides already in registers.  Then after
synchronization, next sublattice is updated and so on. This whole
procedure is repeated $N_{loc}$ times, again taking advantage of
the fact that the field values are already in the shared memory. After
that the kernel writes the shared memory back into global and new
kernel is started processing next subgrid of blocks (see
algorithm~\ref{alg:gpu}).

Monte-Carlo calculations require a good source of random numbers. We
use the Tausworthe pseudo--random number
generator\cite{howes_thomas07} with one copy of the generator per
thread. The performance could be increased by the use of simpler
generator, but we have not attempted this in this work.

\EndFor

\caption{\label{alg:gpu} The GPU algorithm. The CPU algorithm differs by the absence of the loops over the blocks: lines 2-4.}
\end{algorithm}


One of the problems with lattice simulations is the treatment of the
boundary conditions. The algorithm requires access to the site
neighbors during each update. Index of neighbors can be calculated
using simple arithmetics, except at the boundaries. Indexing of
neighbors requires  checking for the boundary at each update or
an expensive modulo operations. Another technique is to use the
precalculated and stored indices: for every site we store the index of
four or six nearest neighbors. This is also very flexible but
requires a large amount of memory. This can have a negative impact on
the performance and is not well suitable for the GPU which usually
have less RAM then CPU's. In our algorithm the checking for boundary
is needed only when loading to shared memory. Then we can use simple
index arithmetics.




\section{CPU implementation}
% CPU implementation
To make a fair comparison with the CPU we have to use both multicore
as vector (SSE/AVX) programming.  The parallelisation on many cores
is relatively easy using the OpenMP. The same restriction apply as on
GPU, so we partition the the lattice in the same way, but we use only
one level {\em i.e.} we do not partition the lattice into blocks.  The
SIMD instructions are used to process four (SSE) or eight (AVX)
updates in parallel (similarly to threads on GPU).  At present only
portable way to use vector instructions is to use compiler
intrinsics\cite{intr}. We have defined our own vector type that uses
combination of the \lstinline!__attribute__((vector_size(N)))!
directive and intrinsics to provide a drop--in replacement for scalar
types.

Unfortunately not all scalar \emph{x86} instructions have vector counterparts,
which is crucial requirement for vectorizing scalar code. In particular
\emph{x86} misses direct vector \emph{XMM} gather and scatter instructions
(load/save vector register data from/to memory indexed by other vector
register), unlike GPU where gather and scatter is key feature. Another drawback
in lack of AVX 256-bit integer operations, which makes random number generator
utilize 128-bit SSE only, even on 256-bit AVX capable CPUs.

In our CPU implementation we use a small ``trick''. Instead of using the
\begin{lstlisting}
        if ( exp(-DeltaH) > r )
\end{lstlisting}
condition for the Metropolis algorithm ($r$ is a pseudo--random number) we use
an equivalent condition
\begin{lstlisting}
        if ( -DeltaH >  log(r) )
\end{lstlisting}

The advantage is now that the argument of $\log$ is independent of
$\Delta H$ and can be calculated beforehand allowing to hide some of
the latency. This implementation is safe even in case when $r$ is
equal zero as $\log$ then returns {\tt -Inf}.  The calculations of the
four or eight $\log$'s in parallel is done using the Intel's svml
library.

As already mentioned in the previous section indexing the neighbors
can be quite costly operation requiring expensive modulo
operations or large amount of memory. However if
we restrict ourself to the lattice dimensions that are powers of two
the nearest neighbor calculations can be made using addition and bitwise
operations. This is quite a restrictive approach, not suitable
for real applications but we have decided to use it for comparison
with the GPU version. This is in some respect the ``upper bound'' of
the CPU performance.


\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

We have tested our implementations on  the following hardware:
\begin{itemize}
\item GPU \emph{Nvidia} GTX 470, 14 Scalar Multiprocessor = 448 CUDA cores, 1.2GHz, CUDA 5.0 Ubuntu Linux 12.04, 1088Gflops.
\item CPU \emph{Intel} i5-2400S Sandy Bridge, 4 core, 2.5 GHz, 12 GB RAM, OSX 10.8.3, GCC 4.8.0 -O3 +OpenMP, 160 Gflops. 
\end{itemize}

The overall performance of the algorithm expressed in Gflops or
updates per sec. will depend strongly on the values of the $N_{loc.}$
and $N_{hit}$. The optimal values of those parameters will depends on
the physics of the model in particular on the values of parameters
$\mu^2$, $g$ and $\Lambda$. To describe the performance in a general
way we have decided to fit the execution time $T$ to the following
model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:model}
T  = a+ V \cdot b +
N_{glob.} V \left(c + N_{loc.}\left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right)\right) . 
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the volume of the lattice.  The interpretation of the
parameters of the model is given in table~\ref{tab:pars-int}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center} \begin{tabular}{lcp{8cm}p{2cm}}
$c$ &--& time per spin needed to load it to shared memory and back.&\\
$d$ &--& time per spin needed to calculate the corona.& 26 ops\\
$e$ &--& time per spin needed to for update including calculation of two
random numbers and exponential. & 64 ops + 1 exp
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{tab:pars-int}Interpretation of the parameters in the
model~\ref{eq:model}. The last column gives the number of numerical operations
performed by the corresponding step of the algorithm.}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|l|l|l|}\hline\hline
 & float & int  & bit \\\hline
coronas & 26 & & \\\hline
$\Delta H  $ & 13  & & \\\hline
PRNG & 1 & 2  & 21  \\\hline
$\widetilde{\vphi}_i \gets \vphi_i+\eta$& 3 & &\\\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{tab:instr-count}Number of instructions in different steps of the
algorithm. float -- floating point, int -- integer arithmetic, bit -- shifts and
bitwise logical. In the last row we do not include the call to PRNG. We do not include the instruction needed for indexing.}
\end{table}

The number of updates is given by
\begin{equation}
N_{up}=V\cdot N_{glob.}\cdot N_{loc.}\cdot N_{hit}
\end{equation}
so the time per update is given by
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\frac{T}{N_{up}}=&\frac{a+ V \cdot b + N_{glob.} V \left(c + N_{loc.}\left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right)\right)}{V\cdot N_{glob.}\cdot N_{loc.}\cdot N_{hit}}\\
\approx&
\frac{ \left(c + N_{loc.}\left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right)\right)}{N_{loc.}\cdot N_{hit}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the data from the table~\ref{tab:pars-int} we obtain that the number of the operations performed is
\begin{equation}
N_{op}=V\cdot N_{glob.}\cdot N_{loc.}(26+\cdot N_{hit}(64+exp))
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  ops=\frac{N_op}{T}\approx \frac{N_{loc.}(26+\cdot N_{hit}(64+exp))}{ \left(c + N_{loc.}\left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right)\right)}
\end{equation}

We have gathered the data on the execution times of the 3D program for
four different lattice sizes. First thing we noticed is that it is not
possible to fit all the data simultaneously to the model
\eqref{eq:model}. However when fitting data for each lattice size
separately we obtain a very good fit accuracy better then $1\%$ on the
average.  This is understandable: the execution time can depend non
linearly on the lattice volume.  One reason is that for small lattice
sizes not all SM on the GPU are used. For the $64^3$ lattice we need
$64^3/128=2048$ threads. With $256$ threads per CTA we use only $8$
thread blocks, which is much smaller than 14 available SM. Even for
$128^3$ lattice the 64 needed blocks will not use the SM evenly. Also
the L2 cache may introduce some non-linear dependence on the lattice
size.

The results of the fits are included on the table~\ref{tab:fit}.

In case of CPU as we do not loop over the blocks the model is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:model-cpu}
T  = a+ V \cdot b +
N_{glob.} V \left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right). 
\end{equation}
The coefficient $d$ is the time per spin needed to load it from and to memory
together with the calculation of the corona. The time per update in this case is given by:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\frac{T}{N_{up}}=&\frac{a+ V \cdot b + N_{glob.} V \left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right)}{V\cdot N_{glob.}\cdot N_{hit}}\\
\approx&
\frac{d + N_{hit}\cdot e}{\cdot N_{hit}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
ops\approx \frac{ 26+N_{hit}(64+exp)}{ \left(d + N_{hit}\cdot e\right)}

\subsection{GPU cache}

The good performance of the presented GPU algorithm comes from the effective
use of the shared memory. We have also checked to which extend this could be
achieved by just using the automatic cache capabilities of modern GPU's. To
this end we have implemented a version of the algorithm which did not use the
shared memory, however the access pattern was the same. The idea was that the
first iteration of the local sweep loop would fill the L1 cache and consecutive
iterations would not need to access the global memory and the performance
should be comparable to our original implementation.

This turned out not to be the case. The algorithm using the L1 cache
was approximately six times slower than the one using shared
memory. This deteriorated performance could be traced back to large
number of cache misses. Nominally the $20^3$ block should fit in L1
cache as it did fit into the shared memory. However the cache line is
32 words long (128B) and the blocks are not aligned on the cache lines
boundaries (see gray points on the figure~\ref{fig:blocks}). On top of
that the cache is probably not fully associative. All that together
implies that the cache size should be up to four or five times bigger
to accommodate the whole block. 


\section{Discussion}

Results presented in table~\ref{tab:comp} show clear advantage of the
GPU over CPU. This is hardly surprising, but the $26\times$ difference
is much higher than comes from comparison of theoretical performance of
tested i5 CPU to \emph{GTX 470}. The GTX is thus more efficient in
that sense that is capable of achieving performance much closer to the
peak. This can be attributed to two main reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item The shared memory that acts as an managed cache allows to use
  the small cache size much more effectively. In particular it is
  possible on the GPU to fit the whole $20^3$ grid block into the
  shared memory. This is not possible using the conventional cache
  both on GPU and CPU leading to large number of cache misses and
  decrease of performance. 
\item Modern CPU are not fully vector processors. Not every scalar
  instruction has a vector counterpart. In particular the eight words
  wide integer instructions are missing from the AVX instruction set.
  This makes it impossible to make a 256-bit pseudo-random number
  generator.
\item Efficient load and store vector (gather/scatter) instruction are
  also missing from CPU.  When not loading/storing from the
  consecutive memory location they are effectively serialized into
  scalar loads/stores.
\end{itemize}

Undeniably the trend of vectorization of CPUs is continuing and the
software that wants to stay competitive must adapt to it.  However, the
current CPU make this more difficult than the GPU, due to the lack of
some crucial vector features.  The CPU producers are already
addressing those issues. Intel Xeon $\phi$ has a extended vector
instructions set and Haswell CPU architecture with AVX2 should be on
sale this Autumn. As a future work we are planning to tests those
architectures.
